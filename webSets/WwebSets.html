         That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential<br>semantics and 
         other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result<br>in the determination that "meant 
         to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase<br>as it seems to be, 
         and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. <br>
         But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. <br>
         It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie."</p>
